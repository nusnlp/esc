S A very important characteristic of the UK constitution , and one which is central to the question of sovereignty , is that it is the Westminster Parliament that is the supreme legal authority in the UK .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S According to the orthodox school which subscribes to the views of Albert Venn Dicey , the Westminster Parliament is omnicompetent and can pass laws on any subject it likes to regulate the activities of any person , anywhere , even those of aliens outside British territory .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In theory , then , the Westminster Parliament could pass a law banning smoking on the streets of Paris .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If our Parliament did so , British courts would be obliged to accept Parliament 's decision and pass judgement accordingly .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , in practise , as the Radical school ( who believe that the Westminster Parliament is not legislatively supreme ) point out , in this hypothetical situation , the Parisiens would take no notice whatever of the UK Parliament 's legislation ; and Parliament would in effect be fettered .
A 4 5|||R:MORPH|||practice|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0
A 50 51|||R:VERB|||bettered|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Dicey said that as each Parliament is omnipotent , and therefore has the power to make or unmake any law , no Parliament could bind its successors as to the content or manner and form of subsequent legislation .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Radical like to point out that since the passing of the European Communities Act in 1972 , the Westminster Parliament has ceded its sovereignty and supremacy to Europe .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The orthodox school retaliate by pointing out that since a Westminster Parliament passed the 1972 Act thereby putting the UK into the European Communities , a future Parliament could just as easily repeal this Act , and take us out of Europe again .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In this case , Britain would have retained her sovereignty and Parliamentary supremacy .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Of course , this whole question is still a subject of fierce debate .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S British courts have avoided a head - on clash by finding ambiguity in a domestic statute and resolving that ambiguity so as to give effect to our Community obligations , or by finding that a statute passed prior to the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed by implication by that Act and does not represent the latest intention of the Westminster Parliament or by arguing that subsequent legislation was inadvertant and that the Westminster Parliament could not have intended to come into conflict with community law .
A 69 70|||R:SPELL|||inadvertent|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In a recent development , the European Court of Justice rule in the case of R v Secretary of State for Transport ex parte Factortame and others ( 1990 ) that courts in Britain must suspend an Act of the Westminster Parliament where the rights of the citizens guaranteed by European Community law may be at risk .

S This case for the first time said that it is a principle of UK law as influenced by the European Court that our Parliament is not supreme in every circumstance .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This seems to be mainly caused by farming methods 20 years ago .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S In the 1960 's and 1970 's , cows were given feed which included sheep ( and their brains ) in its ingredients .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Many animals which ate this feed developed BSE and even more passed it on to their young .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is a belief among the people of the UK that eating beef is dangerous , as they believe that the BSE can be passed on to humans when they eat beef .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S There is no scientific evidence at present to suggest that this is the case .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , cases of CJD and BSE have been widely documented in the media and this has greatly influenced people .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Pictures on the television of cows with BSE who are unable to walk properly and humans with CJD highlight how horrific and debilitating a condition CJD is .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If the media coverage of CJD and BSE continues in the same manner , it is not inconceivable that people in the UK might be so scared that they cease to eat beef entirely .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S If people in the UK were to cease to eat beef , the effect on the agricultural industry would be devestating .
A 20 21|||R:SPELL|||devastating|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Cow farmers would fall in numbers by a huge amount .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is because with the beef market destroyed , the only market open to these farmers would be the dairy products market which is not large enough to sustain many sellers .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The CJD and BSE scare could even spread to dairy products and if this happened , cow farmers would cease to exist entirely .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S However , when people cease to eat beef what do they eat instead ?
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The answer is pork , lamb and other meats .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The increase in demand for the other meats would be approximately proportionate to the fall in demand for beef .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This would mean , that producers of other meats would benefit from people ceasing to eat beef .

S Although cattle farmers could no longer remain in the beef market they could switch from cattle farming to pig or sheep farming and stay in the agricultural industry .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The overall effect on the size of the agricultural industry would be virtually nil .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This is because the fall in the size of the beef market would correspond with a rise in the size of the other agricultural product markets .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S This would mean that the structure of agricultural industry had altered greatly with the proportion of it taken up by the meats other than beef market growing .

S From my point of view , studying in a foreign country has certain drawbacks .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , this way is very expensive as the tuition fee for overseas students is rather high .

S Besides , when you study abroad , you have to adapt to a very different way of life , which can be quite stressful .

S What is more , English teachers do not speak Russian so if you do n't know English well , you will not understand their explanation .

S It is often assumed that it is better to study a language abroad because you can always use it speaking with native speakers .

S However , I doubt that we will have lots of opportunities to speak abroad as we do not know many people there .

S It is also believed that Russian teachers are not as qualified as those in England .

S I totally disagree with this opinion because Russian teachers can compare two languages and explain grammar rules better .

S To sum up , I would argue that the best way to learn a language is to study it in your native country because you can always get the necessary help from your teachers .

S Moreover , today we have lots of opportunities to improve our skills such as communicating with English pen friends over the Internet .

S I think that we should travel abroad so as to practise a language but not to study it .
