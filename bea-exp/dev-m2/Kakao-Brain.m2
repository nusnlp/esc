S Below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
A 1 1|||M:PUNCT|||,|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And all banking operations must be done by phone .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
A 27 27|||M:DET|||the|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S But there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .

S You do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S All in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .

S In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .

S Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
A -1 -1|||noop|||-NONE-|||REQUIRED|||-NONE-|||0

S Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
